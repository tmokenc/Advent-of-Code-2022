## Lessons Learned
Nothing yet

## Error Handle
**NOPE!!!** `unwrap()` everything everywhere

## Use
To run test cases written in the task
```sh
cargo test
```

To run all of the advent of code solutions
```sh
cargo run --release
```
To run only a specific day (replace {DAY_NUMBER} with the number of that day)
```sh
cargo run --release -- {DAY_NUMBER}
```
